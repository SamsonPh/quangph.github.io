Summary
======
I have nearly 7 years of experience in the AI field, including 5 years specializing in natural language processing (NLP) for the Vietnamese language. I am adept at solving NLP problems at both low and high levels, utilizing traditional machine learning techniques as well as deep learning approaches. I have developed and deployed numerous ultra-compact models suitable for edge integration, as well as large-scale models requiring interaction with extensive, distributed infrastructures, such as large language models.

Additionally, I have experience working on projects involving computer vision and signal processing. My cross-disciplinary project background enables me to apply knowledge across various domains, particularly in multi-modal applications.

I am also capable of organizing and teaching beginner-level classes on machine learning and natural language processing.
